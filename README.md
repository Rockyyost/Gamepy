# PLEASE DO NOT USE THIS REPOSITORY

It is being kept up for posterity but the code is actually quite poor (it all
works). I have noticed a few people forking it but please do not (although by
all means make use of the code if you'd like to).

There are a variety of better alternatives:

- Normal Form Games:
    - [Gambit](http://gambit.sourceforge.net/)
    - [Sagemath](http://vknight.org/unpeudemath/code/2014/12/10/sneak-preview-of-game-theory-in-sage-3-of-3/)
- Shapley Value calculation:

- Gale Shapley algorithms:

The agent base model is in fact not quite yet re written but this is an ongoing
piece of work by an MSc student. The repository will be
[here](https://github.com/drvinceknight/agent-based-learn) where the library will
be packaged properly.

Another package that might be of interest is this [Axelrod
library](https://github.com/Axelrod-Python/Axelrod) which
allows you to reproduce the Axelrod tournament.
