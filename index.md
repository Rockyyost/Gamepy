# [Gamepy: some python code for game theory...](./index.html)

This contains some code for a growing number of game theoretical subjects (clicking on each of the packages goes to some short documentation as well as a link to the code):

- Cooperative Game Theory:
    - [Shap.py](./Shappy/Shappy.html) (a library to calculate the shapley value for a cooperative game)
- Non Cooperative Game Theory:
    - [Abm.py](./Abm/Abm.html) (a library to simulate a population of strategies in an evolutionary context)
    - [lrs_nash.py](./lrs_nash/lrs_nash.html) (a library that solves a normal form game using the awesome [lrs](http://cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/~avis/C/lrs.html) library made by David Avis)
- Matching Games:
    - [Gale_Shapley.py](./Gale_Shapley/Gale_Shapley.html) (a library to solve matching games using the extended gale shapley algorithm)

**The code is all available on [github](https://github.com/drvinceknight/Gamepy)** and I'm sure can be improved a lot (for example the current communication with lrs is very clumsy). I'll be continuing to work on this here and there when I have time and would eventually like to package it in to the awesome [sage](http://sagemath.org/).
