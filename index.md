# Gamepy: some python code for game theory...

This contains some code for a growing number of game theoretical subjects (clicking on each of the packages goes to some short documentation as well as a link to the code):

- Cooperative Game Theory:
    - Shap.py (a library to calculate the shapley value for a cooperative game)
- Non Cooperative Game Theory:
    - Abm.py (a library to simulate a population of strategies in an evolutionary context)
    - lrs_nash.py (a library that solves a normal form game using the lrs library)
- Matching Games:
    - Gale_Shapley.py (a library to solve matching games using the extended gale shapley algorithm)

The code is all available on github and I'm sure can be improved a lot (for example the current communication with lrs is very clumsy). I'll be continuing to work on this here and there when I have time.
