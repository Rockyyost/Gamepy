<h1 id="gamepy-some-python-code-for-game-theory..."><a href="./index.html">Gamepy: some python code for game theory...</a></h1>
<p>This contains some code for a growing number of game theoretical subjects (clicking on each of the packages goes to some short documentation as well as a link to the code):</p>
<ul>
<li>Cooperative Game Theory:
<ul>
<li><a href="./Cooperative_Games/Shappy.html">Shap.py</a> (a library to calculate the shapley value for a cooperative game)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Non Cooperative Game Theory:
<ul>
<li>Abm.py (a library to simulate a population of strategies in an evolutionary context)</li>
<li>lrs_nash.py (a library that solves a normal form game using the lrs library)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Matching Games:
<ul>
<li>Gale_Shapley.py (a library to solve matching games using the extended gale shapley algorithm)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>The code is all available on github and I'm sure can be improved a lot (for example the current communication with lrs is very clumsy). I'll be continuing to work on this here and there when I have time.</p>
