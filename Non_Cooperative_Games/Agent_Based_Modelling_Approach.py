- Create population of players,
- Give them random strategies? (Or pure strategies?)
- Choose number of rounds per generation, play those rounds keeping everyone's core
- Once rounds are finished, calculate number of agents that will die due to
death rate
- Until those many agents die, kill worst agent and let best agent replicate with mutation probability mu. Mutation here is probability of picking a new strategy.
- Keep repeating above until number of generations have been created
